/**
Delete Leaves With a Given Value

Given a binary tree root and an integer target, delete all the leaf nodes with value target.

Note that once you delete a leaf node with value target, if it's parent node becomes a leaf node and has the 
value target, it should also be deleted (you need to continue doing that until you can't).

 

Example 1:



Input: root = [1,2,3,2,null,2,4], target = 2
Output: [1,null,3,null,4]

class Solution {
    public TreeNode removeLeafNodes(TreeNode root, int target) {
        if (root == null) {
            return null;
        }
        TreeNode left = removeLeafNodes(root.left, target);
        TreeNode right = removeLeafNodes(root.right, target);

        if (left == null && right == null && root.val == target) {
            return null;
        }

        root.left = left;
        root.right = right;
        return root;
    }
}
