Maximum repeating number 

Given an array Arr of size N, the array contains numbers in range from 0 to K-1 where K is a positive 
integer and K <= N. Find the maximum repeating number in this array. If there are two or more maximum 
repeating numbers return the element having least value.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 4, K = 3
Arr[] = {2, 2, 1, 2}
Output: 2
